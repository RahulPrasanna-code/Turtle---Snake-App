# Turtle---Snake-Game

This is a simple snake game developed using python and turtle library .. It uses basic Object Oriented Programming concepts . 
The source code is open for all , anyone can perform new upgrades to the code

Before using the code make sure to install python in your machine.
Turtle comes along with python so there is no need for any packages to be Installed.
Make sure to run main.py where the main program starts


Thank You
